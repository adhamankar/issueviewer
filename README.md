# Story purpose

### Jira visualization tool for the 3 amigos.

Often as the team size grow, each one of the team members starts working on user stories. Over the period, as teams grow it becomes difficult to trace back the purpose of every story back to the project, and eventually organization goals. 

This tool is an attempt to visually present every story's purpose, aligned all the way to project and organization level. 

When team can easily visualize the hierarchy, we believe it opens up far more channels of collaboration and discussions amongst the engineering and product organizations.
