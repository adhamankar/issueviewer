# Story purpose

### Jira visualization tool for the [3 amigos](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-amigos).

Often as the team size grow, different team members starts working on different user stories. Over the period, as teams grow it is easy to loose track of new features that get added into the product. Nevertheless it is still important to ensure, every story ...and epic ...and initiative eventually align back to the porfolio and organization's goals.

This visual tool is an attempt to visually present every story's purpose, aligned all the way up to project and organization's purpose. 

We believe, when teams can easily visualize the hierarchy, it opens up far more channels of collaboration and discussions amongst the engineering and product organizations.

### Currently only supports jira

This has started as a side project to solve our team's challenges. And since we use jira, the first iteration supports jira integration only.

This is a readonly view - with no support to make changes back to jira issues.

### Features and support

If you find the tool useful, please share you feedback. Also feel free to [add feature requests](https://github.com/adhamankar/storypurpose/issues). I would be happy to extend the tool to meet your requirements, so long as it aligns with the original goals of this tool.

If something isn't working as desired, please raise an issue and we will try to resolve it on priority.
